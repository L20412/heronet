    "content": "'The breach, which occurred in September and was disclosed in October, stemmed from unauthorized access to systems operated by 5CA, a customer service provider. Attackers infiltrated the vendor’s infrastructure and accessed sensitive user data submitted through support channels.\n\nAccording to the platform’s statement, the compromised data includes names, email addresses, IP addresses, and partial billing information. Most notably, over 2.1 million government-issued ID photos were exposed—primarily from users appealing age verification decisions.\n\nEstimates suggest that between 70,000 and 5.5 million individuals may have been affected, depending on the nature of their interactions with support. The platform emphasized that its own infrastructure remained secure and that no user messages or account credentials were accessed.\n\nIn response, the company revoked the vendor’s access, launched a forensic investigation, and declined ransom demands from the attackers. Users who recently contacted support are advised to review their account settings and consider updating their credentials.\n\nThis incident highlights the growing risks associated with outsourcing sensitive operations and raises broader concerns about vendor oversight in the tech industry."

High School has announced a revamped internship initiative aimed at giving first-year students more real-world experience earlier in their training.</p>\n<p>The program, dubbed “Proximity Patrol,” will pair students with local Pro Heroes for short-term field assignments focused on urban surveillance, rescue drills, and quirk coordination. Principal Nezu emphasized the importance of adaptability:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Villains are evolving. Our students must evolve faster.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The announcement comes just days after a coordinated attack on a Hero Supply Depot in Shizuoka, allegedly orchestrated by remnants of the Paranormal Liberation Front. Authorities have yet to confirm the identities of the perpetrators, but eyewitnesses reported seeing a masked figure with a gravity-distorting quirk.</p>\n<p>Among the students selected for the pilot phase are Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, and Shoto Todoroki, whose recent performance during the Joint Training Battle earned high praise from faculty and Pro Heroes alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Reaction</strong><br>While many citizens support the initiative, some have voiced concerns over student safety. “They’re still kids,” said one local resident. “We need heroes, but not at the cost of their lives.”</p>"
